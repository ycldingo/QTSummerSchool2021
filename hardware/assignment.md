# Assignment: NOT Gate with Open Pulse
Please create an experiment to excite the qubit from the ground state via [Open Pulse](https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/pulse.html) feature. We will start from searching for the proper driving pulse frequency to its amplitude. Execute the experiment on a real device and analyze the measurement outcome. Do you obtain 100% of $|1\rangle$ ? Why?
In additional to constructing the driving pulse step-by-step, we can evaluate the theoretical $\pi$-pulse for a qubit directly from the viewpoint of flipping a qubit.
The modified pulse for IBM's superconducting qubit will definitely look different to that of a perfect two-level system. 
Please compare the measurement results for the two pulses and discuss about the difference.
