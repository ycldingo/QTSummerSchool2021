# Investigating IBMQ's Hardware with Microwaves
The IBMQ's quantum computer is based on the structure of transmon, which is actually a multi-level system instead of a perfect two-level.
The lowest two energy states, ground state and the first excited state, are used to form the computational basis $\{ \ket{0}, \ket{1} \}$
