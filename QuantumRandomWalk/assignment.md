# Assignment: Randomly Walks in Quantum and Classical

Please build up a script for one-dimensional discrete-time quantum random walk, with at least $2^4 \sim 2^5$ vertices in position space.
Choose a Hadamard matrix as the coin operator and the initial superposition coin state
$$|\psi(0)\rangle_c = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(|R\rangle + i|L\rangle \right).$$
Please compare your results with the classical analogue, which should distribute normally in position space.
When will a quantum walk reduce to the classical case? Why?
