# Quantum Random Walk on IBM's Quantum Computers
Quantuum random walk is [first studied since 1993](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.48.1687)
and has been applied in variety of research areas. 
Here we plan to demo a standard one-dimensional discrete-time quantum random via IBM Quantum Experience platform. 
The whole system contains two elements, coin and shift operators, with respect to different registers, and are defined in two subspaces: coin $\mathcal{H}_c$, position $\mathcal{H}_p$. 
Students will learn the concepts of Hilbert space, how the initial state (of coin) influences the outcoming state, as well as the method to expanding the basic model to a higher dimensional case. 

In this topic, we will 
1. Build up the programming script on (1)classical and (2)quantum random walks, and compare the resultant outcome probability distributions for the walker's final position.
2. Run the Python script on both simulator and real devices.
3. Discuss about the possible applicatioins on quantum random walks.
