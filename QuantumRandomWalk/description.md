# Quantum Random Walk on IBM's Quantum Computers
Quantuum random walk is [first studied since 1993](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.48.1687)
and has been applied in variety of research areas. 
Here we plan to demo a standard one-dimensional discrete-time quantum random via IBM Quantum Experience platform. 
The whole system contains two elements, coin and shift operators, with respect to different registers, and are defined in two subspaces: coin $\mathcal{H}_c$, position $\mathcal{H}_p$. 
Students will learn the con- cepts of Hilbert space, how the initial state (of coin) influences the outcoming state, as well as the method to expanding the basic model to a higher dimensional case. 
We will eventually compare the results with its classical analogue and discuss the possible applications. 
The script will be run on both simulator and real devices.
